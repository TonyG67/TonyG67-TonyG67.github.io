									<h2>Antonio Guion</h2>
									<p>My name is Antonio Guion. I am from Blounts Creek, North Carolina. I am a Senior at Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) pursuing a major in Computer Science with a concentration in Scientific. I have always enjoyed tinkering with computers, but what really motivated me to pursue this career was my mentor for my senior project. Mr. Glenn Williams showed me that a computer is not just merely a tool or machine; it is a way of making life easier for people</p>
									<p>As a freshman, I was granted the privilege of joining the Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing Education and Research (CERSER) scholarship program, which is led by Dr. Linda Hayden. I am very thankful for the many skills that I have learned, as these skills will aid me in furthering my research. One primary factor I will be able to utilize is how to use LINUX based systems, Dreamweaver, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
									<p>During the spring semester of 2014, I was a part of a research group called Team HUBzero, mentored by, Mr.Justin Deloatch and Mr.Je'aime Powell. Our research was based on creating and understanding HUBzero, uploading a database into our HUB, and installing it to the server. I learned a lot about VMware through creating a HUB and gained a greater understanding of what HUBzero is; HUBzero is a open source software platform which provides a template for scientific and educational activities. VMware is a software which you can test and simulate the process of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual variation of devices and systems that would need hardware. The research I did with my mentor was enlightening and enriching experience</p>
									<p>During the summer of 2014, I was on the TeraScan team, mentored by Mr. Andrew Brumfield. Our research was based around site preparation for 3.6meter X/L band and 3.7meter C-band Groundstation. Where we covered the implantation of TeraScan, and prepping the site for the arrival of the SeaSpace Corporation. TeraScan is an integrated system of hardware and software designed for automated reception of data from meteorological/environmental satellites and for processing the data into images and data overlays. The site preparation part was divided into two parts, dealing with the removal of tops of trees and the reinforcing of the beams. The site preparation is for the arrival of the SeaSpace cooperation on September 8th.</p>
									<p> During the spring of 2015, I was involved in research team that worked on creating a database under the guidance of Jeff Wood. The project title was: "Implementation of an interactive database interface utilizing HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL in support of water quality assessments in the Northeastern North Carolina Pasquotank Watershed." The goal of this project was to manufacture a database system that would house the water quality data gathered by the Summer Research Experience for Undergraduate teams during the summers of 2014, 2013, and 2011.The primary focus was laid upon the how the data would be entered and displayed within the database as it was critical that the database be viable for use will in the field In the summer of 2015, I was involved with a bioinformatics course offered by the Vikings Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (VESTEM) program. During this course I learned the importances of technology plays in bioinformatics.</p>
									<p>In the spring of 2016, I did my first research project titled "Implementation of Social Media for Dissemination of Research Activities at the Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing Education and Research at Elizabeth City State University. My mentor was Jeff Wood. The goal of this project was to figure out how various forms of social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter could be used to promote CERSER. In the future, I plan to take part in internships and to further my education in graduate school with a focus in Scientific, while taking what I have learned in CERSER as a basis for my further learning. After I graduate, I will pursue an occupation in databases, primarily in the field of search engines and system design. </p>
